\section{About This Book}

This book is for those who want a practival guide for the digital universe. We provide a vertical slice approach to learning modern computers. The Computer will teach important concepts using examples that apply to large and small systems, from Mainframes and the "Cloud" all the way down to embedded devices that we interact with everyday.

I wrote this book for a few reasons

1) To offer an entry point for those who want to  look deeper into computers but don't know where to start. With all the advancements and just volumes of work done to advance the field it can be overwhelming to the new learner seeking to understand digital machines from the ground up.

2) When I was a boy your computer was expected ot come with a means to program it out of the box. This "creator culture" was baked right in. Imagine if your iPad foced you to learn a bit about it prior to smashing your finders for an instant dopamine response? Stand back for a second and ask yourself is the computer using you, or you it?

Of course not everyone needs to be a mechanic or an engineer in order to drive a car. I would suggest when the ratio of machanics dips under about 1 in 5 we might be at risk of being controlled by someone elses idea of what and how a car should be. Espessually when its such a critical part of our everyday lives.

3) As a young boy in the 1st grade in 1986 at the dawn of the "desktop revolution". I was dignosed with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, and a shortage of working memory. These "learning disablitlites" that are now covered under the board umbrella of "nuro-divergint". School was difficult as this combo of neruo-processing differences where not all that compatable with standard teaching methods at the time. I was lucky enough that between my parents and teachers exploring new methods to help kids like me achive their potential I had technology thrown at me to help with writing, memory, reading, spelling, math, and early voice dictation. Computers helped me build a model of the world. A simple model that used levels of abstraction and offloaded my own need for route memorization and calculation tasks. As I grew this cross applied to understanding and modelting other difficult concepts like social interactions, philiphipy, econmics, etc. technology became not only a means of accomidation but a model, a microcusim for understanding the universe as it related to me.

So with 25+ years of professional experience in the field now, I thought I would take up the tourch and try to help others discover themselfs and the universe around them though this marvel of mankind, the simple machine capable of so much.
